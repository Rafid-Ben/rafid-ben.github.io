I had the great pleasure to attend the inaugural gathering of the US chapter of Polytechnic Algiers Community in Washington DC. During this event, we had the honor of engaging in a conversation with Dr. Braham Himed, the President-Elect of IEEE Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society (AESS) and an esteemed Alumni of Ecole Nationale Polytechnique from the class of 1984. Dr. Himed shared insights from his extensive 40-year career in scientific research, including his experience in academia, industry, government, and professional organizations such as IEEE and AESS.

I also had the chance to meet and discuss with other Alumni: Achouak Benarbia, Lamia Belhassani, Sihem Tounsi, and Sofiane AMROUN.

The goal of PAC-USA is to create a strong and supportive network of ENP alumni across the United States—to foster professional connections, celebrate our shared identity, and promote collaboration across disciplines.
